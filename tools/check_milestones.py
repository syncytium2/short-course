"""Every row in MILESTONES.md must resolve against the tree it describes.

    python3 tools/check_milestones.py [FILE]     check (default docs/MILESTONES.md)
    python3 tools/check_milestones.py --selftest prove every rule can still fire

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT ITS FIRST VERSION GOT WRONG. A milestone doc's whole value is
that it does not rot, and the failure it guards against -- a document stating as settled
something the commit behind it called open -- is not caught by prose review. The first
version of this file was reviewed by eleven roles and **four of its rules were broken in
ways that all reported success**:

  * the path rule required a file extension, so `src/bugarach/detectors/` and `{d_ok}`
    were never looked at while the summary printed "29 paths" -- coverage reported over a
    set that silently excluded its own members;
  * a directory branch existed and could never execute, because no path the regex matched
    could end in `/`;
  * an empty document printed "OK -- every row resolves" and exited 0;
  * the evidence/decided rule fired on "K was never decided" and PASSED "was never an open
    question", which is the exact sentence the real decay used.

So every rule below is exercised by `--selftest`, in both directions where it has two. A
rule that cannot fail is not a check, and this file has already shipped four of them.

RESOLUTION TARGET. Commits are checked for ancestry (that claim IS the row's content).
Paths are checked on the FILESYSTEM, because MILESTONES' own rule is that a row lands in
the same change as the work it describes -- resolving paths against origin/main would make
the documented workflow impossible and would fail on a shallow CI clone.
`tests/test_index_resolves.py` reached that conclusion first; see its lines 99-104.

VENDORED from `bugarach @ tools/check_milestones.py`, 2026-09-02, and the vendoring is the
point rather than a convenience. An estate count taken the same day: of twenty coordination
and verification instruments, fourteen lived in exactly one repository, and every one that
had travelled fires automatically. This one has to be invoked, which is the class that never
moves -- so it was carried by hand, and that act is milestone row M1 in `docs/MILESTONES.md`.

TWO DEVIATIONS FROM UPSTREAM, both stated rather than silent:
  * `base_ref()` tries `origin/master` and `master` before `origin/main` and `main`. This
    repo's trunk is `master`; upstream's is `main`. Both orders are kept so the file can be
    carried back without a second edit.
  * the base-ref failure message names the wider list, for the same reason.
Nothing else is changed. When upstream moves, diff against it rather than re-deriving --
`dragnet.py TERM` in `armory` finds every variant in the estate, including the ones off-trunk.
