THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO END
------------------------------
The agent file-send channel does not reach the user in the VS Code extension, and it
**returns success anyway**. Measured in this repo on 2026-09-01: `display=render` with an
SVG and `display=attach` with plain text were both sent, both returned
`1 file delivered to user.`, and neither produced anything on screen. Upstream:
anthropics/claude-code#76739 — open, `has repro`, labelled macos + windows + vscode, no
maintainer response, filed at CLI 2.1.207 and still failing at extension 2.1.252.

That is the estate's "can the alarm ring?" family: a check that reports success while
doing nothing. One session narrated **six** figures as seen across a long working
session; the user only found out by opening a deployed site himself. The session
briefing gate — *"a visual finding? render the figure and show it"* — was satisfied every
time by a call that did nothing, so nothing failed anywhere in that loop.

WHY A PATH AND NOT A FILE
-------------------------
The fix is not a better pipe. It is an artefact that persists somewhere the user already
looks, plus **the absolute path printed as text**. `open` returning 0 proves the launcher
started, exactly as little as `1 file delivered` proved. The difference is that the file
is still there afterwards, so "I showed you X" is a claim the user can contradict. A
gate resting on this one is falsifiable; a gate resting on the send channel is not.

Never say a figure was shown on the strength of a call returning success. Print the path.

THIS FILE IS VENDORED. EDITING IT IS AN ESTATE EDIT, NOT A REPO EDIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Copies of this file are installed in other repositories, each stamped with the commit it
was taken at. That stamp covers the consumer direction only. The reverse is not written
anywhere and is the one that bites: **changing this original does not update them.** They
are pins. Re-vendoring is a separate decision, and it belongs to whoever is running the
vendor pass rather than to whoever edits this file.

A pin can also be stranded rather than merely stale — pushed to a consumer on a branch that
was never merged, so the copy exists in the repository and not in anyone's working tree.
Do not infer from an index that a consumer HAS this file; check the consumer.

WHERE IT GOES
-------------
`<review root>/<project>/`, one folder per project, resolved at runtime — by default a
Dropbox folder the maintainer's machines already sync, or anywhere `ARMORY_DARKROOM`
points. The rule it exists to keep: **never write a figure to a scratch or temp path,
because a human has to find it.** A path under /tmp satisfies the code and not the reader.

THE ROOT IS RESOLVED, NEVER SPELLED
-----------------------------------
`dropbox_member_root()` reads Dropbox's own `info.json`, which names the real local path,
so the macOS cloud-mount-vs-symlink distinction never has to be reasoned about and Windows
needs no second branch. Business account first — that is the one holding the review folder.

⚠ This matters beyond convenience: **the member folder contains the user's name.** Every
file that has ever leaked a personal path here did it the same way — by spelling that root
out from `Path.home()` plus literal folder names instead of asking the system where it is.
One such file was deleted from its own repository for exactly that.

The literals are therefore not quoted anywhere in this file, and `--selftest` asserts it by
checking this source against the root it resolved at runtime — so the check needs no copy
of the name in order to look for one. That assertion went red on its first run, against a
docstring that had spelled the folder out while explaining not to.

So: resolve at runtime, hold it in memory, print it to the terminal, and write it to no
file. This module records the path nowhere.

USAGE
-----
    tools/show.py FIG.png                  copy to the review folder, open in the viewer
    tools/show.py FIG.png --code           open as a tab in VS Code instead
    tools/show.py FIG.png --no-open        place it and print the path, open nothing
    tools/show.py A.png B.pdf              several at once
    tools/show.py --where                  print the review folder for this project
    tools/show.py --selftest               prove the resolver and the copy work

    --project NAME    override the project folder (default: the git repo's name)
    ARMORY_DARKROOM   the review folder to copy into. Set this on any machine that has
                      no Dropbox install for the tool to read a default from.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
0 only if every file was placed. A failed *opener* is reported but does not fail the run:
the file is placed and the path is printed, which is the delivery that matters.
