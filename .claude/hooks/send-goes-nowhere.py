"""PostToolUse gate. A file sent to the user is answered with the fact that it arrived nowhere.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    `SendUserFile` does not deliver in the VS Code extension, and it RETURNS SUCCESS ANYWAY.
    Probed directly 2026-09-01: `display=render` with an SVG and `display=attach` with plain
    text were both sent, both returned "1 file delivered to user.", and neither produced a
    card or an inline preview. Upstream anthropics/claude-code#76739 -- open, `has repro`,
    labelled macos + windows + vscode, filed at CLI 2.1.207, still failing at 2.1.252.

    The failure is undetectable from inside the session, so every convention resting on the
    channel is unfalsifiable. The session briefing's rule -- "a visual finding? render the
    figure and show it" -- was satisfied every time by a call that did nothing. One
    session narrated SIX figures as shown across a working day; the user found out by
    opening a deployed site himself.

WHY A HOOK AND NOT A LINE IN A DOC. It is also written down, in a register of failures
whose checks could not have fired. Written down, it has to be REMEMBERED -- by a session
that does not know the channel is broken, which is every session that has not yet been
bitten. A rule that must be recalled at the moment of use is not a control; a rule that
fires by itself is. This is the half that fires.

WHY PostToolUse AND NOT PreToolUse. The same argument an empty-search gate makes: the
call itself is not a mistake. Sending a file is a reasonable thing to do, and on a client
where the channel works it is the right thing. The mistake happens one step later, when the
success return is read as delivery. So the trigger is the CALL HAVING HAPPENED, not the
arguments -- and unlike a blocking gate this costs a session nothing it can lose.

IT ANSWERS, IT DOES NOT ONLY WARN. A hook saying "that may not have arrived" leaves the
session where it was. This one names the remedy: tools/show.py, located from this file's own
path, with the exact command including the file that was just sent.

WHAT IT DOES NOT KNOW. The payload carries no client identity, so this hook CANNOT tell
whether the session is attached to the VS Code extension (where delivery is confirmed
broken) or a terminal (where it may work). It therefore does not claim the send failed. It
states what is confirmed, and points at a delivery that is verifiable on every client --
which is better than a working send regardless, because a printed path is a claim the user
can contradict and a success return is not.

THIS FILE IS VENDORED. EDITING IT IS AN ESTATE EDIT, NOT A REPO EDIT.
Copies of this file are installed in other repositories, each stamped with the commit it
was taken at. That stamp covers the consumer direction only: **changing this original does
not update them.** They are pins, and re-vendoring is a separate decision. A pin can also be
stranded rather than stale -- pushed to a consumer on a branch nobody merged -- so do not
infer from an index that a consumer HAS this gate. Check the consumer.

RETIRING IT. Retire a probe in the same commit that retires its
subject. When #76739 closes and delivery is confirmed on this machine, delete this file and
the register entry together -- a gate that fires about a fixed bug is noise, and noise is how
an alarm stops being read.

SELF-CONFIGURING. show.py is located from this file's own path, so this hook and tools/show.py
can be copied into any repo unchanged.

EXIT  0 always. This gate never blocks.
      python3 .claude/hooks/send-goes-nowhere.py --selftest   to check it still fires.
