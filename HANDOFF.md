# Handoff — course work moves here

**2026-08-26.** Everything about the short course now lives in this repo. The murderboard repo
is for murderboard development only; see [Boundary](#boundary) below.

## Where things are

| You want | It is at |
|---|---|
| The outline | [`course-outline.md`](course-outline.md) — draft 3, four numeric defects fixed |
| What still blocks it | [`OPEN-FINDINGS.md`](OPEN-FINDINGS.md) |
| The 11-role review | [`docs/reviews/course-outline_murderboard_2026-08-26.md`](docs/reviews/course-outline_murderboard_2026-08-26.md) |
| How the reconstruction failed | [`docs/reviews/reconstruction-vs-log_2026-08-26.md`](docs/reviews/reconstruction-vs-log_2026-08-26.md) |
| The origin (8 points) | [`docs/chain/00-the-eight-points.md`](docs/chain/00-the-eight-points.md) |
| The session, reconstructed | [`docs/chain/01-session-record.md`](docs/chain/01-session-record.md) — superseded where it conflicts with 1a |
| The session, real (partial) | [`docs/chain/01a-real-log-partial.md`](docs/chain/01a-real-log-partial.md) |
| Why the repo exists | [`README.md`](README.md) |

Local only. No remote. `git log` is the record — every commit is titled by the defect it fixes.

## Tomorrow morning, in priority order

The outline says both sessions are **tomorrow morning** and the pre-work email goes **tonight**.
That ordering is what makes the list below urgent rather than tidy.

### 1 · Tonight — the pre-work email
Highest-leverage item available before the morning, per the outline itself: install, verify it
runs, make a scratch folder. Setup friction at minute five is what kills these sessions, and it
lands hardest on the faculty.

### 2 · Before Session B — fix the sandbox (B1, blocking)
Currently: *"everyone makes a scratch directory now."* A directory constrains nothing an agent can
do with `cd`, `~`, or an absolute path. You are telling students they are contained when they are
not, in the session you identified as the one where damage happens.

Minimum acceptable fix, if no real mechanism fits in 90 minutes: **say plainly that the directory
is a habit, not a wall.** Better: `chmod -R a-w` on a copy of real data, or Claude Code's own
permission settings. Do not let "sandbox" mean "folder."

### 3 · Before Session A — decide what to say about the gap (B2, blocking)
"Nobody is teaching a non-programmer to do agentic work on their own machine and their own files"
is false. Oxford's AI Competency Centre runs it for non-programmers on their own research data;
UW eScience and Southampton run adjacent workshops. Replace the vacancy claim with a contrast
claim and name them — citing your competition is what a scientist does.

Same for B4: §8 is nominated as the closer on the grounds nobody else covers trusting code you
cannot read. They do. The distinction is the reader — Market B's *declines* to read the hook;
yours *cannot*.

### 4 · This week — three emails (closes B5)
Write to the Oxford, UW eScience and Southampton organisers. Ask what their sessions cover and
what failed. One email each and the positioning section stops being guesswork. Cheapest check
available and the only one that settles it.

## Two things the record lost — put them back

Neither is a defect fix. Both are content the session produced and the reconstruction dropped,
found by comparing node 1 against node 1a. Verified absent from `course-outline.md`.

**The §5 concession.** *"Instructions still get a step, honestly labelled. Step 4 adds the rule to
CLAUDE.md, with 'the steps above make the rule enforceable; this one states it.'"* Draft 3 concedes
something weaker (instructions as tie-breakers). This version is better because it comes from
someone who built the gates and still wrote the sentence — and it models honest labelling, which is
the whole discipline.

**The most honest slide in either session.** The murderboard came out of the same calcium-imaging
project as §9's bloat. Rigorous gates for the documents; the data architecture still unfixed. One
half got cured because the failures were legible and repeated; the other got sliced around because
the workaround was cheap. **Same person, same project, same year.** Draft 3 has both halves and
never puts them together, which is the entire point and the best answer available to "why should I
believe any of this."

## Open questions carried forward

From the outline's own list, still unanswered: which failure gets demoed (a real logged one beats a
manufactured one, and it needs to run on data that looks like theirs — though see below); whether
§2 still earns a section; whether §8 is the closer or gets split; whether to name the tool.

**One of those is already answered and the outline doesn't know it.** The open question asks for
"3–4 real failures from my own logs." This repo is now four of them, documented, with commits:
a course about checking said 482 words when the file says 433; a commit count that was never 79;
a line count that was true for one day; and a claim that one commit in ninety-one represents the
standard. Plus this repo's own two — a commit that did more than it said, and a README that
asserted the errors were unchecked when the log shows the tools ran.

They are not failures on data, which is what Session B needs. For Session A they are better than
data failures, because the audience is being asked to trust the person at the front, and these are
his.

## Boundary

**The murderboard repo is for murderboard development only.** Course material, session plans,
reviews of course material, and anything in this chain belong here.

Enforced rather than remembered:

- `murderboard/.claude/settings.local.json` runs a PreToolUse guard that blocks writes into the
  murderboard tree for paths matching course/outline/lesson/slide/session patterns. Local only —
  it is in the globally-gitignored settings file, so it does not ship to anyone who vendors the
  repo.
- `murderboard/CLAUDE.md` states the scope in one line, honestly labelled as a statement rather
  than a gate.

The guard is narrow and it is a heuristic. It will not catch course work filed under a name it
does not recognise. That is stated here rather than left for you to discover, because a gate whose
coverage is overstated is the failure mode this whole estate exists to avoid.
